This applies to Mario Kart 7, Mario Kart 8, and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Some vehicles have completely different stats when used with Bowser or ultra-lightweight characters compared to other characters. See the 'Stat Display Inconsistencies' section below for details. Some vehicles have exceptionally high stats in certain areas, such as the Stellar Sled with +11 water speed, far exceeding all other vehicles. While it's unclear why Nintendo designed it this way, this value should be accurate. The 'Speed' and 'Handling' shown in the game interface appear as single values, but are actually the sum of three sub-stats. The values displayed in-game are only rough averages and not precise. The 'Terrain Stats' listed in the table are only tiers (e.g., 1 is slower than 2), not actual values. To obtain actual values, data mining is required. Some tiers are not used by any vehicles in the game, such as no vehicle having terrain speed tier 3. This can be verified by comparing characters and vehicles with similar tiers. Characters themselves likely have hidden 'Handling' sub-stats that are currently unknown and under investigation."
